# Welcome to Advent of Code[^aoc]

This repository will contain my solutions for all years. Currently I'm in the process of merging separate repos into this one.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] – an annual event in December since 2015.
    Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
    A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
